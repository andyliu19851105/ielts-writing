### Today, the advanced science and technology have made great changes to people 's life, but artists such as musicians, painters and writers are still highly valued. What can arts tell us about life that science and technology cannot?

In the 20th century with development of electrical industry, the life style has changed and the life has become easier with modern utilities and human being owe this modern life to advanced science and technology. But as being of a mankind, all of us have some other requirements that relate to our spirit and feeling which can be appeased by arts like music and painting. This is why artists are highly valued yet and why we need art.

In my opinion, all people need to know about other people attitudes to improve their life and do not repeat other people mistakes or remember their victory to motivate themselves. One of the ways for becoming aware of one 's attitude is the language of art for example when you read a book, you can become familiar with different points of view of author. But when you use a microwave, however it helps you easy and fast cooking, you never understand for what reasons it is invented and what was the motivation of the inventor.
Another important thing that art present to people is calm and peace. Nobody can deny that listening to a light music after a long day work can help us to refresh and recover ourselves to get new energy. However today there are lots of modernized and computerized entertainments like computer games and chat room for hanging out lots of time but hey cannot take the place of art and just they make us distant from healthy mind. Good or bad, it is the result of today life that all of us are in rush from morning and we do not have any time to think about our behavior even one minute a day. We can rectify by learning an art as an entertainment instead of playing computer games and wasting time.

The language of art is different from language of technology and their positions in our life are not the same. Technology makes our life easier and faster but never can improve our morals directly and that is art which can fill our feeling gaps by treasures and make our life happier.

Science and technology allow society to continuously come up with inventions that help mankind and they are still developing at a high speed. However, some people believe that many forms of art that have been in existence for many years should be more highly valued than science and technology as they have unique values. This essay explores the benefits of the arts that people cannot gain from science and technology.

Firstly, there are concepts such as feelings, emotions and inspiration that come from the arts, whereas science and technology cannot offer them due to its focus on practicality. For example an audience can indirectly experience and have a feeling of melancholy from listening to Beetoven's pieces which were composed while he was suffering from unfortunate events. In contrast, science cannot offer this because it cannot deliver the same kinds of feelings.

Moreover, some forms of art get people to think about themselves and help them connect the artwork to reality. For instance, some people may take a visit to a photo exhibition on a topic of a daily life of children in the third world because it makes them think about how fortunate their life is compare to theirs and appreciate what is given to them. Again, pure science and technology cannot offer this opportunity because its concept is based on structures, formulas and the process of trial-and-error.

There is no doubt that science and technology is essential to our lives and it plays a large role in the 21st century. However, there are many other intangible aspects people cannot gain from it but can from the arts that include feelings and inspiration. Therefore, it is crucial to not undervalue the arts and preserve it for the benefits it has.

There is no doubt that the quality of our lives in the 21st century has been greatly improved by various scientific and technological advances. Despite this, the arts and humanities too still have much to teach us about ourselves and life in general.

One area in which we can learn from the arts is that concepts such as beauty matter in and of themselves, whereas in the world of science and technology the only true measure is whether something works or not. This is a limited view of the world and the arts differ in that they offer us an alternative and more spiritual outlook. For example, if we listen to Mozart we can learn about harmony and joy through the medium of music or if even we read an author like PG Wodehouse we learn about the value of humour. These essential aspects of life are absent from the clinical world of science and technology.

The other way in which artists can teach us more about life is that enjoying art encourages the habit of self-reflection. If you walk into an art gallery, attend a concert or even just stay in to read a book, you will almost certainly begin to think about your inner values. For me, this is a invaluable lesson in life because if we begin to reflect about ourselves, we begin not just to become more human, but also consider the lives of others too.

So while science and technology may have made our physical lives more comfortable in the 21st century. It remains true that the arts and humanities are still absolutely necessary for ordinary people as they promote a more spiritual and reflective view of life that is essential to our humanity.
