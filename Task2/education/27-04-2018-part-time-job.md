### In many countries, teenagers are encouraged to do part time job. Some think it is a good thing while others disagree. Discuss both view and give your own opinion.

- Starting
  Many nations around the world, particularly the developed ones,


- Good

  It is no doubt that the part-time career could bring various developments in teenagers lives, specially the team spirit. It is easy to understand that part-time job could help teenagers learn how to work as a team member and share responsibility. It means that students could realise how to compromise with other employees when situation comes and teenagers will also learn about the friendship as well that comes from the teamwork.

- Bad
  No time focus on studying.

  The teenagers should focus on their study instead of earning money. working in young age can also have negative effects, focusing on studies can be denied easily. Obtained fewer marks in studies would close the door of many good job opportunities. For instance, doctor, scientist, lawyers need to focus on their studies rather than part-time.

- In conclusion
  Although teenagers join the part-time job could bring many great advantages for them, from my point of view, it is better for teenagers to devote their time and efforts on their lessons as it is their most important responsibility.

  reduce the family finance burden.

  Take me as a example.
  I am a student of Melbourne University, only tuition fee almost 30000 per year.
  if with living fees, it would be around 40000 per year. My family just a common working family.
  Thus, this is the big finance burden for my family.


### In some countries, young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies.


Taking a study break after high school and before starting university is very common in certain countries. Many people take a year break to either travel and explore different countries or they may take up some job in gain experience. This practice has both pros and cons.

- Good
Travelling could helps them to improve their inter-personality skills. Also they can learn a lot of things about the country like culture, fashion, language and so on. This is the absolute way to explore their mind and gain social knowledge.

Working is one of the best options to learn business strategies over a small span of time. It is the place where you get to work with people from different age groups. And good for you get to some sort of experience about understand the working pressure and cooperation with coworkers. And before initiating their college life, they get some sort of experience about industrial demand in the global job market and save some money for the future.

- Bad
On the other hand, one gap year of break can also have negative impacts on teenagers.
Students take up a break from their studies might not continue with their studies after a year. As they are juvenile, they could have lack in decision making. It might be a hindrance to their future carrier. There will be a chance of inequality among students in the university, between the rich and poor students.
