### In some countries, the number of old people is increasing. Some people say that it causes problem to these country, while others say that old people plan an important role in society. Discuss both view and give your own opinion.

Nowadays, the increasing of ageing population becoming the un-avoid problem in some countries. There are conflicting views about this ageing population.
Some people say that it causes finance problem to these country, but other people say that old people plan an important role in the society. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument, followed by my own perspective.

On the one hand, the growth population of old people could bring huge finance burden to the countries. It is easy to understand that the ageing populations pose a challenge to the macroeconomic stability through increased government spending on pension and health care. This may hurt economic growth and overall quality of life if government need to divert public spending from education and infrastructure investment to finance programs for the elders. For example, at the end of 2017, China had more than 330 million people over the age of 65, the China government invested more than 3.19 trillion yuan on the pension and healthy care for these retired people. It is a huge finance burden for China.

On the other hand, old people play an important role in society, specially in improving the social skills for the younger generations. By interacting with teenagers, seniors are about to share important life lessons. On the flip side, the younger generations are able to teach seniors new ways of looking at life. Thus the younger generations could equipped with excellent social skills are able to communicate with others effectively, so that they could get along with people with various backgrounds. This would result in strong sense of belonging and connection.

In conclusion, it is the truth that growth population of the old people could bring the huge finance burden to the countries. However, from my perspective I think the seniors bring the benefits for the younger generations, specially for the improving of the social skills.
