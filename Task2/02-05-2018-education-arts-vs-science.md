### While some people think that art if an important subject for children to study, others think it is a waste of time. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.


#### Art is Useful

- art is a means of expression
  - children need to learn to express their thoughts and feelings
  - it is often easier for young children to draw pictures than to express complex feelings in words
- art is a creative form
  - creative thinking should be developed
  - creative thinking is beneficial later in life

#### Art is A Waste of Time

- there are other more important subjects that would benefit children for their future life
  - the importance of technology, sciences
- studying art does not lead to a successful career
  - most artists struggle to make a living from selling their art

#### Opinion

- art is a valuable subject but should not be a main focus on any curriculum or detract from other more important subjects
- having a balance of subjects is the best way to help children develop a balanced character in life
