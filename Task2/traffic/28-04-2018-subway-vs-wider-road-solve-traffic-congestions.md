### Some people believe government should spend money on building train and subway lines to reduce traffic congestion. Others think that building more and wider roads is the better way to reduce traffic congestion. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

Traffic congestion has become the bane of citizens in many parts of the world. In order to mitigate this problem, some suggest that public transportation, such as trains and subway lines should be constructed. Meanwhile, others are firm in their belief that building wider roads makes more sense. Both of these methods will be analysed below.

On the one hand, building trains is an effective method to improve traffic condition. There are compelling evidences to support the investment in public transportation. For example, in Beijing, it was by continuously expanding the underground railway system that the government has encouraged a majority of its residents to use subways rather than private vehicles. This significantly reduced the amount of vehicles on Beijingâ€™s roads.

However, others who express doubts on this approach. Their suggestion is that a better way to alleviate traffic jam is to make bigger road systems.
In Australia, compared with places with narrow roads,  areas where roads are wider are reported to have better traffic conditions.  Also, more roads provides drivers alternatives to travel to a destination instead of flooding into one route, which results in a less congested roadway. This especially benefits popular places such as shopping malls or airports that always attract lots of people.

To conclude, both methods discussed above provide sustained relief on our roadways, Therefore, it is necessary for the government to make contributions in both areas.
