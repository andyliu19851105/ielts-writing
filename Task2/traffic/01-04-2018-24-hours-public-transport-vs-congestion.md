### The best way for governments to solve the problem of traffic congestion is to provide free public transport 24 hours a day, seven days a week. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

With the unprecedented growth of population, many regions, especially big cities, now have to deal with traffic jam. While some suggest supplying public transport hourly and daily without charge, I do not believe this is the best way to reduce congestion

On the one hand, public transportations will help to bring down the number of private vehicles on the road in cities. It means that if private vehicles such as motorcycles and cars get decreased on roads, the traffic congestion will significantly decline. For instance, the recent survey of BMW company, in New York city, the traffic congestion is significantly down than any other cities in the USA because of excellent public transport system usage of public, is the best evidence.

On the other hand, I disagree that the operation of public transport should be in 24 hours a day, and seven days a week. In fact, providing free public transport in the long term may be unachievable due to its huge cost. This approach would only bring the huge financial burden to the governments but it would unable to address the root of the traffic issue. According to the majority of reports, traffic jams mainly occurs durning the peak hours, so it is pointless to providing public transport all the the time.

In conclusion, although I accept that the free public transport could restrict traffic congestion, I disagree with the idea that the operation of public transports should work all the time. In years to come, I strongly believe that more investments on road systems should be adopted to make commuting more comfortable and time-saving.
