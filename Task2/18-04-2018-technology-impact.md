However, the technology also has a negative influence on interpersonal relationships. When people interact with people in real life situations, they may encounter serval difficulties: children tend to feel shy to talk with strangers, adults may lack the social manners in communication or misunderstanding others' message. These problems will impair their social skills and prevent them build a strong bond with people.
