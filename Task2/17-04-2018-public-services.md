### Government should focus spending only on public services, not waste on the arts. To extend do you agree or disagree.

According to many people, the investment in art like music and theatre are nothing but cause of money. They believe that this can be utilised to fulfill the increasing demand for public services like hospital and schools. Although I agree that it is important to spend money on public services, I do not think spending on the arts is a waste of money.

It is no argument that the government should spend money on public services. And it is easy to understand that public services are the things such as hospital, schools and these things determine the quality of life that most of us will have. For example, a hospital with all the diagnostic equipment could scan enables clothes to detect diseases at early stage. And school should provide some mobile devices and the the applications they support, will help prepare students for their future careers. Thus, government authorities must invest more finances in these essential public services to strengthen their basic infrastructure.

On the other hand, the arts should also be protected by the government as public services. It the true that the arts are the history of a city or a country, which reflect the culture diversity. Some arts are even regarded as the national treasure, such as Chinese ink and water. As a result, arts should deserve government's funding in order to inherit the culture and let people understand their own culture and history.

In conclusion, I can confidently state that government should invest more in public services. However, I do not believe that financial funding for the art is a total wastage as this too provides important benefits.
