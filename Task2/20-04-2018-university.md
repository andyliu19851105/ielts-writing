### Some people think that universities should not provide theoretical knowledge, but give practical trainings that are beneficial to society. Do you agree or disagree?

In the past, a majority of academics have held the opinion that universities should only offer a theoretically-based approach to teaching throughout their courses, as opposed to the relatively recent trend towards the empirical acquisition of knowledge involving more “hands on” experience. Is this the most effective way for students to learn vital academic information while undertaking their degrees? Undoubtedly, advantages and disadvantages of both academic learning styles have to be evaluated.

Firstly, on the one hand, despite being the more traditional educational approach, learning from theory in relevant academic discourses to identify established knowledge allows us to gain a professional insight. For example, students can easily identify facts and opinions from past discourses. In addition, students acquire knowledge more easily when given relative theoretical examples to build upon. For instance, in subjects such as history or sociology, studying textbook examples allows students to unravel complex academic theories which they could expand on. Alternatively, there are some disadvantages for students.

On the other hand, there is no doubt that students could find themselves reading tedious and monotonous academic papers. For instance, university degrees involving the evaluation of numerous ‘long-winded’ academic discourses provide a little inspiration for students, discouraging enthusiasm. Obviously, interest can be stimulated through empirical research in class. By this, I mean that ‘the human brain learns best by doing’. Although time-consuming, there is no substitute for learning from making mistakes.

In conclusion, while both approaches have benefits and drawbacks in our ever-changing academic world, I honestly believe that a more practical approach promotes a stronger acquisition of academic knowledge. In spite of the comprehensive nature which theoretical teaching can possibly provide, practical learning equals more positive learning for future generations.

School environment has always equipped the humanity by providing them education for a better live. In today's world, Many individuals argue that universities tend to give more theory lessons rather than "hands-on" teaching during the courses. I Honestly believe that both the methods should be balanced in order to prepare the adolescents to exceptional career prospects.

Primarily, There are some courses that required persons to be prepared more through practical experience. Mechanical course as example, used to teach more "hand- on" exercises as the human brain learn better by doing and of course, in such case, it results more effective than simple learning on the books. To illustrate, a friend of mine who is currently working as a machine operator, has recounted that he learned the most during his training period instead of classroom. Hence, for certain degrees it is easier to understand through practice rather than theoretical knowledge.

On the other hand, theory itself is also important because it is the base of practical knowledge. There are indeed, such disciplines that required more theoretical subjects, so that the young will prepare in a better way for their future workplace. For instance, physiotherapy course is mostly based on theoretical hours, as the students need to learn about human body. My uncle, who is a physiotherapist has told me that although it could seem stressful, all the time spent on theory helps a lot to understand regard this job itself. Therefore, for few jobs, learning from books and teachers, it result more suitable.

To conclude, as an overall judgement, It could be said that both the approaches are useful in their own manner. However, it depends on the course to which method give more importance.

### Some people think that universities should provide graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace. Others think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer. What's in your opinion, should be the main function of a university?

Whether a university’s role should be to prepare graduates for specific jobs or simply to educate without a particular vocation in mind is a debatable issue. This essay believes that universities fulfill both purposes. The essay will first discuss the function of vocational courses, followed by a discussion of more traditional tertiary education.

Some students have a very specific job in mind when they enroll at university. Medicine, dentistry and accountancy have clear career paths and they allow people to focus on and then undertake a certain profession upon graduation. This suits those who have decided on a career and it avoids them wasting time studying a more general subject like English. For instance, in the United States, you must complete four years of higher education before you can study law and many feel that these four years are a waste of time, that would have been better used focusing on their chosen discipline.

However, this is not suitable for everyone and many people have no idea what job they would like to do when they are 18. For these young people, it is better to do a non-vocational course, such as philosophy and simply add to their intellect without a career goal in mind. If they were forced to study a more practical subject, they are more likely to quit or become disillusioned because they don’t see the point of their chosen subject. For example, The Times recently reported that only 50% of law graduates actually want to become lawyers at the end of their studies.

In conclusion, the function of college is to both prepare students for the workforce and provide knowledge and which one a person chooses should depend on their preference at the time.
