### Some people think that universities should not provide theoretical knowledge, but give practical trainings that are beneficial to society. Do you agree or disagree?

In the past, a majority of academics have held the opinion that universities should only offer a theoretically-based approach to teaching throughout their courses, as opposed to the relatively recent trend towards the empirical acquisition of knowledge involving more “hands on” experience. Is this the most effective way for students to learn vital academic information while undertaking their degrees? Undoubtedly, advantages and disadvantages of both academic learning styles have to be evaluated.

Firstly, on the one hand, despite being the more traditional educational approach, learning from theory in relevant academic discourses to identify established knowledge allows us to gain a professional insight. For example, students can easily identify facts and opinions from past discourses. In addition, students acquire knowledge more easily when given relative theoretical examples to build upon. For instance, in subjects such as history or sociology, studying textbook examples allows students to unravel complex academic theories which they could expand on. Alternatively, there are some disadvantages for students.

On the other hand, there is no doubt that students could find themselves reading tedious and monotonous academic papers. For instance, university degrees involving the evaluation of numerous ‘long-winded’ academic discourses provide a little inspiration for students, discouraging enthusiasm. Obviously, interest can be stimulated through empirical research in class. By this, I mean that ‘the human brain learns best by doing’. Although time-consuming, there is no substitute for learning from making mistakes.

In conclusion, while both approaches have benefits and drawbacks in our ever-changing academic world, I honestly believe that a more practical approach promotes a stronger acquisition of academic knowledge. In spite of the comprehensive nature which theoretical teaching can possibly provide, practical learning equals more positive learning for future generations.

School environment has always equipped the humanity by providing them education for a better live. In today's world, Many individuals argue that universities tend to give more theory lessons rather than "hands-on" teaching during the courses. I Honestly believe that both the methods should be balanced in order to prepare the adolescents to exceptional career prospects.

Primarily, There are some courses that required persons to be prepared more through practical experience. Mechanical course as example, used to teach more "hand- on" exercises as the human brain learn better by doing and of course, in such case, it results more effective than simple learning on the books. To illustrate, a friend of mine who is currently working as a machine operator, has recounted that he learned the most during his training period instead of classroom. Hence, for certain degrees it is easier to understand through practice rather than theoretical knowledge.

On the other hand, theory itself is also important because it is the base of practical knowledge. There are indeed, such disciplines that required more theoretical subjects, so that the young will prepare in a better way for their future workplace. For instance, physiotherapy course is mostly based on theoretical hours, as the students need to learn about human body. My uncle, who is a physiotherapist has told me that although it could seem stressful, all the time spent on theory helps a lot to understand regard this job itself. Therefore, for few jobs, learning from books and teachers, it result more suitable.

To conclude, as an overall judgement, It could be said that both the approaches are useful in their own manner. However, it depends on the course to which method give more importance.
