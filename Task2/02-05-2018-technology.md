### Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected personal relationships ? Has this become a positive or negative development?

Advances in technology have without doubt influenced the way we communicate with each other in a number of different ways. While some of this change can have a negative influence on the we way interact, my view is that overall modern technology typically improves communication in personal relationships.

It is clear that technology has changed the way we communicate in several respects. Perhaps the clearest example of this is that nowadays many people prefer to keep in touch to their friends and relatives using applications and social networking sites like FaceTime, Skype and Facebook. Another way this change is evident is how the email and texting have almost completely replaced the letter as the primary form of written communication. Because these modern forms of communication are typically much more convenient and instant, one result is that we can communicate more easily with people who we do not see on a daily basis.

It would argue that these innovations have mostly improved personal relationships. It is easy to understand that if modern communication dominates our life, we may encounter several difficulties when we interact with people in real life. Such as Children tend to feel shy to talk with strangers; adults may lack the social manners in communication or misunderstand others' message. These problem would impact our social skills, which preventing us from building a strong bond with people or society.

In conclusion, the technology has changed the way in which people interact with each other. There are convincing arguments both for and against this new type of relationship, however, I think that this has become a positive development.

My conclusion is therefore that new forms technological communication have in fact largely improved human interaction because emails, texting and social networks enable us to maintain friendships which might otherwise be lost.
