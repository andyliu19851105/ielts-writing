### The best way for governments to solve the problem of traffic congestion is to provide free public transport 24 hours a day, seven days a week. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

With the unprecedented growth of population, many regions, especially big cities, now have to deal with traffic jam. While some suggest supplying public transport hourly and daily without charge, I do not believe this is the best way to reduce congestion

On the one hand, public transportations will help to bring down the number of private vehicles on the road in cities. It means that if private vehicles such as motorcycles and cars get decreased on roads, the traffic congestion will significantly decline. For instance, the recent survey of BMW company, in New York city, the traffic congestion is significantly down than any other cities in the USA because of excellent public transport system usage of public, is the best evidence.

On the other hand, I disagree that the operation of public transport should be in 24 hours a day, and seven days a week. In fact, providing free public transport in the long term may be unachievable due to its huge cost. This approach would only bring the huge financial burden to the governments but it would unable to address the root of the traffic issue. According to the majority of reports, traffic jams mainly occurs durning the peak hours, so it is pointless to providing public transport all the the time.

In conclusion, although I accept that the free public transport could restrict traffic congestion, I disagree with the idea that the operation of public transports should work all the time. In years to come, I strongly believe that more investments on road systems should be adopted to make commuting more comfortable and time-saving.

### Some people believe government should spend money on building train and subway lines to reduce traffic congestion. Others think that building more and wider roads is the better way to reduce traffic congestion. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

Traffic congestion has become the bane of citizens in many parts of the world. In order to mitigate this problem, some suggest that public transportation, such as trains and subway lines should be constructed. Meanwhile, others are firm in their belief that building wider roads makes more sense. Both of these methods will be analysed below.

On the one hand, building trains is an effective method to improve traffic condition. There are compelling evidences to support the investment in public transportation. For example, in Beijing, it was by continuously expanding the underground railway system that the government has encouraged a majority of its residents to use subways rather than private vehicles. This significantly reduced the amount of vehicles on Beijing’s roads.

However, others who express doubts on this approach. Their suggestion is that a better way to alleviate traffic jam is to make bigger road systems.
In Australia, compared with places with narrow roads,  areas where roads are wider are reported to have better traffic conditions.  Also, more roads provides drivers alternatives to travel to a destination instead of flooding into one route, which results in a less congested roadway. This especially benefits popular places such as shopping malls or airports that always attract lots of people.

To conclude, both methods discussed above provide sustained relief on our roadways, Therefore, it is necessary for the government to make contributions in both areas.
