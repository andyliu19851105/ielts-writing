Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Mark Kim. I saw your advertisement today and would like to apply for the position.

I majored in nursing in university and used to work in a local hospital for one year. Also, I did volunteer work for the government to give free treatment for homeless old people for two years. Not only for work experience, I like to spend time listening to their stories and sing with them.

Not only because I have professional skills and work experience, but also my love and patience for old people make me apply for this position. If I am lucky enough to be chosen to work for you, I would like to devote my passion and knowledge to help old people in your nursing house.

Since my place is very near your location, just 0 minutes by bus, it would be easy for me to work there. By the way, I am taking a course in treatment for the old at a night class. which will end next Friday. So please be kindly to contact me at 010-0010-1101 during daytime and give me an answer.

Thank you very much.

Yours faithfully,
Mark Kim
