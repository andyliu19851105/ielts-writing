### You need a translation of a document into a different language. And you have a friend who speaks that language.

Write a letter to your friend. In your letter:

- explain what the document is and why you need a translation
- explain why this is urgent and import to you
- ask your friend if and when he/she will be able to help you

Dear John,

It has been a long time since we last contacted, and I hope this letter finds you well.
I'm writing to request you to translate a document from English into German as I know you are fluent in both languages.

I'm happy to inform you that I have been invited to work in a Germany for a major IT company. The company HR request me to provide the translated copy of my Birth certificate and I need to have it translate it to German.

Actually, this needs to be done as soon as possible because my contract is starting after two weeks and I can not join the company without providing necessary documents. Only pending item for joining is this certificate document.

I hope you understand how important for me to get the document translated. It would be helpful if you could do this within three days. In case you don't have time to do this within mentioned time please let me know in advance.

I hope to hear from you soon.

Best Wishes,

Kerry
