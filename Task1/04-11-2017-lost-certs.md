### You company sent you to study a course In a foreign country. You got the certificate, but you lost it.
Write a letter to the principal of the college and explain.
- How did you lose your certificate
- Why do you need it
- What would you like the principal do to help you?

Dear Sir or Madam,

I’m writing this letter to require a new certificate, which is related to the AWS practice course in your college.

I’m a developer in MYOB which is the most innovation company in Australia. Currently, our company are working with your college on a large project called “SEA”. As a team leader in the project, my company would like send me to your country for 3 months, to finish the AWS practice course. And the course will start next Month.

Unfortunately, I lost my certificate when I went back to home yesterday. I couldn’t remember all the details what had happened yesterday, but the truth is my certificate with my wallet all gone.

Actually, for the certificate, there is a registration ID on it. I need use it to register as a valid student in the AWS practice course. If I fail to register next week, I may not be able to attend his training, thus missing out on this rare opportunity.

Therefor, would you please re-generate a new digital certificate for me. And please send the new one to my working email: kerry.Johne@myob.com. I think it should not be hard on your side, but that's means a lot for me.

I am looking forward to hearing from you and if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Your sincerely

Kerry
