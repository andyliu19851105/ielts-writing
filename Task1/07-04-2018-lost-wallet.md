- give them instructions of how to send it back to you


Hi John,

I hope this letter find you and your family well.

I want to thank you for inviting me at your home for a whole week holiday. Actually It was one of the best holidays that I had. Indeed, I will always cherish the great time I spent with your family.

However, on my return to home, I forgot my wallet in your house. The last thing I remember was I put it on top of the drawer near your bedroom, I hope it still there. It contains some Identification cards and bank credit card. All of them are really important for me.

I apologise for the inconvenience but could you please send it by an express post service to my current address, which is 23 Irving Avenue, BoxHill, VIC, 3128.
I will take care of all the expenses so please send me your bank account details as well.

I am looking forward to hearing from you and send my best regards to your family.

Best regards,

Kerry
