I read your advertisement about recruiting volunteers for the upcoming Australia Open Tennis Tournament to be held next month in Sydney. I wish to participate in the event since I have been playing professional tennis since five years of age.

During my tennis career, I have volunteered for several local, provincial, national and international tennis tournaments ranging from the Sydney Tennis Club matches to Australia Open in 2016. I have carried out activities such as managing the crowd at these events and ensuring adequate facilities for the players. Consequently, I have enough experience not only in actual volunteering work but also in training other volunteers.

Using my experience of the past events I suggest the organizers of this year’s event must pay greater attention to residential facilities for the international players. Last year the players informally complained about non-functioning airconditioners and inadequate water for morning ablutions.

I look forward to participating and offering my valuable services in this event.

I read your advertisement about recruiting volunteers for the upcoming National Basketball Matches at New Delhi. I wish to participate in the event since I am a basket ball fan and I have extensive experience in volunteering for various sports events.

I have volunteered for several local and state level cricket, tennis and football events. My experience includes not only in helping prepare the field for these matches but also in preparing seating arrangements. For basketball matches, I can play diverse roles ranging from polishing the floor for optimal performance of players to the door-to-door advertisement of the event.

Volunteering for these events is my passion since it helps me to meet the star players of different games. Moreover, it helps me network with managers and team members of various clubs. I wish to gain extensive experience in sports and hope to work in a sports team someday.

Looking forward to your response
