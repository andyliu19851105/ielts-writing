### You need to take leave from your work of over one month for personal reasons.

Write a letter to your boss. In your letter:
- explain the reason for the leave and the length of leave you need
- explain how you will keep up-to-date while you’re away
- suggest how your work could be covered while you are away

Dear Mr. Smith,

I am writing this letter to advise that I will be away from 10th April this week to 15 May as my annual leave and will take my whole family back to China.

As you know, I have already been our company for two year, but less back to my home country. My wife has been keen to have a long time travel in China for long time, which I had promised her. I am quite sure that I could relax myself and enjoy the journey during this period.

I have already communicated with my colleague Jason who is currently working with me in the “SEA” project.
He will able to complete the work for this project, since he has full context about this project.
I will also make certain that all of my pending work will be handled in advance.

Even I was in China, I still will be reachable anytime at my email or phone, in case of any urgency.

Looking forward to your approval and please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any concern or question.

Thanks,

Yours faithfully,
Kerry
