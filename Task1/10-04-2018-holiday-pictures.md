## Last month you had an overseas holiday with some friends where you stayed at their house. They have just sent you some holiday photos.

Write a letter to your friends. In your letter:

- thank them for the holiday and the photos
- explain why you didnâ€™t write earlier
- invite them to come and stay with you
