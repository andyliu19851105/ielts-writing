### You are rented an apartment for a holiday last year and you are happy with it although there is a problem with it. You want to rent it again this year.

Write a letter to the owner. In your letter:
 - why you are happy with it
 - what is the problem (and how to improve it)
 - give information of the details and dates you required


Dear Mr. Wilson,

I am writing in the hope that my wife and I would be able to rent your beach front cottage for our holiday, like we did for our anniversary last year.

We loved staying at your cottage last year, and feel that the accommodations really made our anniversary special. We upgraded our stay to include jet ski rentals, and plan to do the same this year.

If it is possible, we would really appreciate being provided with a security lock for our cottage door. When we stayed last year, the lock had rusted away and we did not feel safe leaving our bags in the room.

If the cottage is available for July 18-25, we could be very happy to book it. Please contact me if it is available for rent, and to confirm that the door will have a secure lock.

We look forward to hearing from you soon, and to staying at your beautiful cottage!

Yours sincerely,

Kerry
