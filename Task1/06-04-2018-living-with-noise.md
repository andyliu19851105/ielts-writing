Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing this letter to complain about the constant noise coming from the construction work day and night.

My name is Kerry and live at 23 Irving Avenue, BoxHill, where all the construction for the new post office is under progress.

The main problem is the nosies generated by all the heavy machinery and digging of the ground. It seems starts around 6:00 am in the morning and continues until 10:00 pm at night. I have a small baby who is unable to fall asleep due to the construction noise. And lack of sleep stresses the whole family out. I am sure there are other families affected by the noise as well.

I would advise the council to take a serious note of this situation to the company and agree on the timing for the major work.
Particularly, no construction from 8 pm to 8 am.

Iâ€™m looking forward to hearing from you, and if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Thank you in advance, hoping this issue will be resolved soon.

Your faithfully,
Kerry
