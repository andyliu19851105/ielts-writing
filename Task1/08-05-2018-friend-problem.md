Dear John,

I just received your email yesterday, and it's good to hear from you.

In your letter, you told me that your team try to follow the Agile approach to improve your team development efficient, in order to solve the un-visibility issue for the whole team. Actually, half an year ago, our team met the similar problem, so I understand what's your feeling.

Actually, half an year ago, our team follow the waterfall development approach, we only have team meeting each two weeks and team member pick up new task only from Team Leader, which means only Team Leader has the view of the whole project, this become the bottle net of the project.

After this half an year's practicing, the whole team feel it's a great way we used for the project.
And we still loving to follow this pattern. Thus I could give your team two suggestion below, all based on our practise.

- Involving the standing up meeting in the morning.
- Involving the "Jira" as a team management tool.

These two approaches I highly recommend, which will give you a huge help to improve the visibility of your team.

Please drop me a line when you are free and I really expect to see any feedback from your team regarding to the new Agile development approach.

Best Regards,
Kerry
