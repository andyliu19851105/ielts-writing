### You bought a ticket to a music concert. However, you are unable to go, so you decide to offer your ticket to a friend.

Write a letter to your friend. In your letter:
- tell your friend the details about the concert
- explain why you are unable to go
- explain how your friend can receive your ticket

Hi John,

I hope this letter finds you well. I'm writing this letter to offer you a concert ticket which I won't be able to use.

Do you remember that I told you I was going to a piano concert this Saturday? There's an up-and-coming singer and pianist who's playing at the Opera Theatre. It's easy for you just find the details in Google, right. :) The concert start at 7:30pm, but the main performance will start at 8:30pm.

The reason why I'm offering you my ticket is that I have to visit a important client in Europe to help with a Product Launch, and I won't be back until Tuesday.

If you're free on Saturday evening and you'd like to go, I will send it to you by a express service to your address. Don't worry about the expenses, I will take care all of it.

I hope you can attend it, and enjoy the concert!

See you soon,
Kerry
